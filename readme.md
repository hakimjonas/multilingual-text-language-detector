So this is a solution for the task. It's a first "quick and dirty" version. I have used the polyglot nlp pipeline (https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
There might be more elegant solutions both in how to leverage polyglot and also for concatenating sentences of the same language. But it works!
